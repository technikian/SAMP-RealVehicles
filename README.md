# SAMP-RealVehicles
script I wrote years ago for san andreas multiplayer, includes a full personal vehicle management system for players

haven't used in years, so I've uploaded all (I hope) of its dependencies as well

# Features
Speedo system
Fuel system
Vehicle ownership system (including a menu for players to manage their owned vehicles)
All vehicles (including non-owned by players) save their current condition in the game (damage, mods, position, etc)
API for other parts of the gamemode to safely interact with the more complex vehicle system
